- q: What is Breeze?
  a: >
    Breeze is a free, open-source performant frontend for Magento 2.
    It consists of two parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A module that replaces default JS stack with our own implementation.
        We removed a bunch of js libraries and greatly reduced script evaluation
        time. This part could be used on top of custom Luma-based theme.
      </li>
      <li>
        A theme created from scratch with built-in critical and deferred CSS splitting,
        razor sharp images for all devices, RTL support, keyboard navigation.
        It doesn't use Luma or Blank theme as its base.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Take a look at live demos on the <a href="/themes">separate page</a>.

- q: What JS was removed?
  a: We removed everything except Knockout.

- q: Why did you keep Knockout?
  a: >
    We did that for easier migration from Luma to Breeze stack. In future, we
    plan to remove it from our integrations and dynamically inject it into the
    page only if some module will require it.

- q: Can I use Breeze with my Luma-based theme?
  a: Yes, you can install <code>swissup/breeze</code> module separately.

- q: Will my current modules work with Breeze?
  a: No, if it uses JS.

- q: How do I integrate my modules with Breeze?
  a: >
    You can read our <a href="/docs/integration-tips">integration tips</a>
    but we recommend to hire a professional developer for this.
