# Updates
{:.text-center.text-zinc-800.sm:text-5xl.sm:font-black.md:text-6xl}

## Draft

> swissup/breeze:2.19.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.9.0 swissup/breeze-evolution:2.3.0

**🚨 Backward incompatible changes**

 -  We've renamed `@listing-swatch-` variables.
    While old variables working well for now, you should update your themes and
    rename LESS variables according to [our guide](/docs/upgrade-guide#upgrading-from-2180-to-2190).

**🎉 Improvements**

 -  Improved color contrast to pass WCAG tests.
 -  Improved navigation using the keyboard.
 -  We've disabled Turbo. You can still enable it from Breeze configuration, but
    we will remove it eventually according to the [Turbo deprecation](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze/issues/72).
 -  Removed layout shift on product and category pages caused by ColorSwatches.
    To accomplish this task we've added two new LESS variables:

    ```sass
    @swatch-options__min-height: @16;
    @swatch-options__listing__min-height: @swatch__listing__size;
    ```

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Fixed missing `active` class on active menu item.
 -  Fixed not working "Print" button on the "Compare products" page. Fixed by [Ibrahim Saleh](https://github.com/IbrahimS2).
 -  Fixed "Contact" page styles when third-party module replaces Contact Form.
 -  Fixed hardcoded `.breeze-block-hero-title` icon dimensions. Fixed by [Filippo Bovo](https://github.com/Pirosauro).
 -  Fixed not working region updater in ParadoxLabs_Authnetcim module.
 -  Fixed js error when submitting the form with `<input name="method"/>`.
 -  Fixed `undefined is not an object` js error when using Paypal_PayLater module.
 -  Fixed incorrect path to preload image when it contains `@` symbol.
 -  Fixed address data loss after first visit to the shopping cart page.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  New `require.async` function added for easier loading of dynamic dependencies.
    Usage example:

    ```js
    click: async function () {
        const [a, b] = await require.async(['a', 'b']);
        // ...
    }
    ```

 -  Added ability to activate/deactivate focus trap using Cash widget:

    ```js
    $(el).focusTrap(true|false);
    ```

 -  Added ability to load [`tabbable` library](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable)
    without `focus-trap`:

    ```js
    const [tabbable] = await require.async(['tabbable']);
    ```

## September 18, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.18.0

**🎉 Improvements**

 -  Added missing `inventory/configurable-variation-qty` mixin.
 -  Do not stop the next inline script execution when one is broken.

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Fixed possible "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error.
 -  Fixed double "totals-information" reload at the cart page.
 -  Fixed disabled "Submit Review" button when recaptcha is active.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  Fixed ability to pass function as a second argument in `$.get|$.post` functions.
 -  Added `$.mixinSuper` utility. It works in the same way as [`$.mixin`](/docs/mixins)
    except parent method is not passed as a first argument, but available via
    `this._super()` call.
 -  Added `mage/utils/wrapper` utilities:

    ```js
    define(['mage/utils/wrapper'], (wrapper) => {
        console.log(wrapper);
    });
    ```

## September 4, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.16

 -  Fixed PHP error when Magento_CSP module exists but disabled.
 -  Improved error reporting when unable to load js component.

## September 3, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.14

 -  Fixed broken styles at checkout page when `use_css_critical_path` is enabled
    and Magento_CSP module is used.
 -  Fixed possibly broken HTML code after DOMDocument parser.
 -  Non-critical CSS styles are now deferred even if `use_css_critical_path` is disabled.

## August 13, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.12

 -  Allow method chaining when using $.Deferred object:

    ```js
    $.Deferred().then(fn1).fail(fn2);
    ```

 -  Fixed not working combined [onInteraction](/docs/components#oninteraction)
    and [onReveal](/docs/components#onreveal) load rules:

    ```xml
    <item name="load" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="onInteraction" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
        <item name="onReveal" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="0" xsi:type="string">.selector</item>
        </item>
    </item>
    ```

 -  Allow resolving js dependencies from nested properties:

    ```xml
    <item name="braintree" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="path" xsi:type="string">https://js.braintreegateway.com/web/3.97.2/js/client.min.js</item>
        <item name="global" xsi:type="string">braintree.client</item>
    </item>
    ```

    Now, the following code will work as expected:

    ```js
    define(['braintree'], (client) => {
        // Breeze will load remote js and properly resolve
        // exposed window.braintree.client property
        console.log(client);
    });
    ```

 -  Gallery dots styles moved to separate `.bz-gallery-nav-dots()` mixin for easier
    reuse per media query:

    ```scss
    & when (@critical) {
        @media @media-md-down {
            .breeze-gallery:not(.opened) .thumbnails {
                .bz-gallery-nav-dots();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

**🚨 Backward Incompatible Changes**

 -  All scripts except `core` and `knockout` bundles are now asynchronously loaded.
    This means that you have to define dependencies of your scripts using `import`
    section:

    ```diff
     <item name="Vendor_Module/js/catalog-add-to-cart" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="path" xsi:type="string">Vendor_Module/path/to/file</item>
    +    <item name="import" xsi:type="array">
    +       <item name="priceUtils" xsi:type="string">Magento_Catalog/js/price-utils</item>
    +    </item>
     </item>
    ```

 -  In case if your js creates mixin for built-in component, you need to add
    `mixins` property to your js declaration:

    ```diff
     <item name="Vendor_Module/js/catalog-add-to-cart" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="path" xsi:type="string">Vendor_Module/path/to/file</item>
    +    <item name="mixins" xsi:type="array">
    +       <item name="catalogAddToCart" xsi:type="string">catalogAddToCart</item>
    +    </item>
     </item>
    ```

 -  Scripts are no longer automatically loaded unless used in `require()`, or `data-mage-init`.
    If you have the scripts that are not used in `data-mage-init` and `require()` calls,
    and you want to load it every time when bundle is loaded, you need to add
    `autoload` property to your js declaration:

    ```diff
     <item name="items" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="custom-js" xsi:type="array">
             <item name="path" xsi:type="string">js/path/to/file</item>
    +        <item name="autoload" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
         </item>
     </item>
    ```

## Apr 1, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.15.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.7.4,swissup/breeze-evolution:2.1.9

**🚨 Backward Incompatible Changes**

 -  $.post and $.get functions no longer accept second argument as ajax request options.
    Now, it's always parsed as ajax request data to send. This change aligns the functions
    with jQuery Ajax API.

    Old, incorrect way:

    ```js
    $.post(url, {
        data: {},
        success: () => {}
    });
    ```

    New, correct way:

    ```js
    $.post({
        url: url,
        data: {},
        success: () => {}
    });
    ```

    for the frontend developement.

## Mar 4, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.14.1<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.7.1

**👔 Added compatiblity with AdobeCommerce.**

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  Inline scripts with `require()` calls are **no longer removed** from the DOM
    structure. This was done to simplify integration of third-party modules.

## Feb 2, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.13.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.6.3

**🚀 Performance improvements**

 -  **[Dynamic JS](/docs/components#dynamic-component) feature added.**

    This feature allows to dynamically inject js components after specified event,
    or when some element is revealed in the viewport, or after first user interaction.

    Super useful for complex themes packed with tens of modules. Take a look at
    javascript size reduction on initial page load in our themes:

    Theme           | v2.12     | v2.13 | Improvement
    ----------------|-----------|-------|------------
    BreezeEvolution | 129kB     | 108kB | 16%
    ArgentoChic     | 225kB     | 111kB | 51%
    ArgentoForce    | 168kB     | 111kB | 34%
    ArgentoStripes  | 167kB     | 111kB | 34%

 -  **Added lazyload backgrounds for pagebuilder elements.**

    Pagebuilder slider, banner, and other components use background image
    property to create image. This makes impossible to use loading=lazy attribute
    and browser download all images on intial page load. We postpone loading of
    these background images until visitor scrolls to them.

    Theme           | v2.12     | v2.13 | Improvement
    ----------------|-----------|-------|------------
    BreezeEvolution | 276kB     | 169kB | 39%
    ArgentoChic     | 477kB     | 380kB | 21%
    ArgentoForce    | 691kB     | 432kB | 38%
    ArgentoStripes  | 712kB     | 410kB | 42%

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  **Allow extending custom uiComponents using `.extend()` function.**

    The code below is now fully compatible with Breeze:

    ```js
    define([
        'customComponent'
    ], function (customComponent) {
        'use strict';

        return customComponent.extend({...})
    })
    ```

    See real usage in [our repo](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze/blob/master/view/frontend/web/js/components/cart/totals.js).

 -  **Allow registering anonymous uiComponent using `Component.register` function.**

    This tricky mechanism allows to reuse Luma-based files. Take look on how we
    reuse files in our integrations with [AmastyXsearch](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-amasty-xsearch/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js),
    [MagefanBlog](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-magefan-blog/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js),
    [SmileElasticSuite](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-smile-elasticsuite/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js).

 -  `uiRegistry` component added.
 -  Added/improved jQuery polyfills: `$.each, $.now, $.isObjectEmpty, $.get, $.post`
 -  `$.fn.onReveal` function added with an ability to pass IntersectionObserver options.

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Fixed possible missing items in the header Account dropdown.
 -  Fixed possible infinite spinner on initial page load.
 -  Fixed possible horizontal scroll on customer registration page when DOB field is shown.
 -  Fixed js errors after multiple fast clicks on the same link.

## Jan 17, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.12.0

 -  Allow using `@` in html attribute names.
 -  Improved `$(document).on('breeze:load')` event listener. It will now trigger callback even if "load"
    was triggered before event was attached. Similar to `$(document).ready()` from jQuery.
 -  Allow using body CSS class in `$.async('classname')` calls.
 -  Allow storing functions using `$.fn.data` method.
 -  Register all components constructors in $.breezemap.
 -  Improved `$.loadScript` function to prevent duplicate requests and preserve script execution order.
 -  Added [debug mode](/docs/settings) support for ajax requests.
 -  Small fixes to improve integration with Luma-based modules.

## Nov 28, 2023

> swissup/breeze:2.11.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.6.0,swissup/breeze-evolution:2.1.6

**Breaking Changes**

 -  We've changed the code that will show login popup:

    ```js
    // old code
    $('.block-authentication').modal('openModal');

    // new code
    $('#authenticationPopup').authPopup('showModal')
    ```

    The old code will not work anymore because of performance optimizations -
    `.block-authentication` is no longer exists in DOM structure until popup is shown.

    So, if you've used `$('.block-authentication').modal('openModal');` to show
    login popup, you need to replace it with new call.

**New Features and Improvements**

 -  The message about proper performance setup added to the backend panel.
 -  Improve critical image preload on homepage and category pages.
 -  [$(el).lineClamp()](/docs/line-clamp) widget added to use in pair with new `line-clamp-[1..6]` utilities.

    - Utilize single event listener for all lazy callbacks.
    - `breeze-inactive` class added to the body until first user interaction.
 -  Ability to run some logic in the widget when element [appears in viewport](/docs/widgets#onreveal).
 -  Color swatches are now render its options when element is visible.
 -  Added ability to hide currency title using `currency-separator` and `currency-title` classes.
 -  Added ability to use `absolute` position for [actions block](/docs/listing#actions-primary-and-secondary) when using grid listing.

**Fixes**

 -  Fixed js bundle redeployment during `setup:static-content:deploy` command.
 -  Fixed possible incorrect scroll offset on the product page.
 -  Fixed incorrectly processed tab clicks, when multiple tabs instances with same ids found on the page.
 -  Fixed not working slider for related products block.
