# Updates
{:.text-center.text-zinc-800.sm:text-5xl.sm:font-black.md:text-6xl}

## October 6, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.26.0<br/>
> swissup/theme-frontend-breeze-blank:2.11.7,swissup/theme-frontend-breeze-evolution:2.5.4

**🎉 Improvements**

 -  [Slider Gallery Mode](/docs/gallery#slider-gallery-mode) added.
    It's enabled by default in Breeze Evolution theme.
 -  Slider component:
    -  Performance improvements.
    -  Vertical direction support added.
 -  Gallery component:
    - Improved keyboard control.
    - Clicking the thumbnails no longer opens the lightbox. This is more expected behavior.
 -  Magento Payments Services module [support added](/extensions#magento-payment-services).
 -  Improved fullscreen mode in iOS 26 for Product Gallery, Mobile Navigation,
    and Category Filters panels.

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Safari and Firefox: do not open the gallery when customer wanted to swipe the image.
 -  Safari: fixed not working first click if a dom mutation is used in `$.lazy` callback.
 -  Fixed inability to stop the video after gallery was closed.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  Scrollend event support added. You can write the following code and
    it will just work in all browsers. We silently load [scrollyfill](https://github.com/argyleink/scrollyfills/)
    polyfill when browser doesn't have native support.

    ```js
    $('selector').on('scrollend', () => alert('scrollend'));
    ```

 -  Fixed ability to create components using `new` keyword:

    ```js
    define(['uiComponent'], (cmp) => {
        return new cmp(options);
    })
    ```

## September 8, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.25.0<br/>
> swissup/theme-frontend-breeze-blank:2.11.6,swissup/theme-frontend-breeze-evolution:2.5.3

**🎉 Improvements**

 -  Accessibility improvements.
 -  Improved compatibility with third-party modules that extend built-in components.
    [Paypal_BrainTree](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-paypal-braintree)
    module is now working with Breeze without any overrides!
 -  Allow using url in `.breeze-icon()` mixin: `.breeze-icon('../images/hello.svg')`
 -  H1 tag added to the homepage in Blank and Evolution themes to fix SEO warning.
 -  Expanded gallery mode is now using one column to match modern fashion sites style
    by default.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  `.componentAsync()` method added. Useful to retrieve dynamic component that
    may not initialized yet:

    ```js
    const gallery = await $('.selector').componentAsync('gallery');
    ```

**🚨 Breaking changes**

 -  We've aligned `$.ajax|$.post|$.get` functions with jQuery to allow using them
    with `await` keyword:

    ```js
    var data = await $.ajax(...);
    ```

    This results in the following backward incompatible change when using `.then()`:

    ```js
    // Old way to use $.ajax.then
    // Callback receives full response object
    $.ajax(...).then(response => {
      var data = response.body;
    });

    // New way to use $.ajax.then
    // Callback receives only response body
    $.ajax(...).then(data => {
      //
    });
    ```

## September 1, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.24.12

 -  Fixed slider behavior on RTL locales.
 -  Fixed double animation issue when using infinite slider.
 -  Reduce style recalculation tasks on initial page load.

## July 7, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.24.9

 -  Multiple fixes the the component resolving logic.
 -  Cleanup old files before deploying new bundles.
 -  Added missing `$.parseJSON` function.

## May 22, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.24.1<br/>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.11.2,swissup/breeze-evolution:2.5.2

 -  [Speculation rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) added.
    No need to activate them separately. They just works.
 -  Fixed possible incorrect diplayed price when changing the quantity at the bundle product page.
 -  Fixed incorrect hover background for StorePickup toggler at checkout page.
 -  Evolution theme: Fixed missing store switcher and not working recaptcha for newsletter.

## May 15, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.24.0

🚀 Added flexible ways to manually lazyload non-critical images and preload LCP image:

 -  [Image lazyload block added](/docs/image-lazyload)
 -  [Image preload block added](/docs/image-preload)

## May 13, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.23.0

 -  **Infinite slider** support added.
 -  Improve performance of the slider initialization function.
 -  Fixes missing `+` in the phone validation message.
 -  Fixed A11y errors reported by Wave tool.

**🚨 Breaking changes**

 -  Since the sliders are working asynchroniously, the following code will
    not work as expected:

    ```js
    $(element).pagebuilderCarousel(options);
    $(element).pagebuilderCarousel('instance').slider(); // may return null
    ```

    The proper way is to listen to `pagebuilderSlider:ready` event to get the slider
    instance:

    ```js
    $(element)
        .on('pagebuilderSlider:ready', () => {
            $(element).pagebuilderCarousel('instance').slider();
        })
        .pagebuilderCarousel(options);
    ```

## April 23, 2025

> swissup/module-breeze:2.22.3

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  Allow using Luma-based components without `component:` declaration inside bundles.
    To use this feature, make sure that all of the dependencies listed in the `import` section.

    Usage example:

    ```xml
    <item name="algoliaAutocomplete" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="path" xsi:type="string">Algolia_AlgoliaSearch/js/autocomplete</item>
        <item name="anonymous" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
        <item name="import" xsi:type="array">...</item>
    </item>
    ```

 -  Fixed js error when passing success and error callbacks to the `require()` function.
 -  Improve resolving dependencies from global `window` object.

## April 18, 2025

> swissup/breeze-blank:2.11.1,swissup/breeze-evolution:2.5.1

**🚨 This update may require updating your theme code**

 -  Background of the hovered button state is now controlled by `--button-hover-bg` css prop.

    If you used the following code:

    ```less
    .mybutton:hover {
        .lib-rgb(--button-bg, #f00);
    }
    ```

    You should update it as follows:

    ```less
    .mybutton {
        .lib-rgb(--button-hover-bg, #f00);
    }
    ```

 -  Fixed invalid color values passed to `rgba()` function for a `button-link` component.
 -  `@button__hover__background-alpha` default value is now 1. Previouly is was `0.9`.
 -  `@button-secondary__hover__background-color` default value is `var(--gray-300)`. Previouly is was `false`.
    You may need to declare this variable with proper color code if the background of
    the secondary button in hovered state is not correct:

    ```less
    @button-secondary__hover__background-color: #f00;
    ```

 -  Reduced amount of layout recalculation tasks by adding a `display: none` style for all dropdown elements.

## December 20, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.19.3

**🚀 Performance**

 -  Significant performance boost for the menu's with large category count.

    We tested performance with 3000 categories and 1000 dropdown items and here are the results:

    - **Before:** One large task - 600ms. **TBT - 550ms.**

    ```js
    $('selector').microtasks(1000).append('html').addClass('class');
    ```

    This function will split `$('selector')` items into chunks (1000 per chunk)
    and perform `append` and `addClass` methods in separate **async tasks**.

    ```

## November 20, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.19.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.9.0 swissup/breeze-evolution:2.3.0

**🚨 Backward incompatible changes**

 -  We've renamed `@listing-swatch-` variables.
    While old variables working well for now, you should update your themes and

**🎉 Improvements**

 -  Improved color contrast to pass WCAG tests.

 -  Removed layout shift on product and category pages caused by ColorSwatches.
    To accomplish this task we've added two new LESS variables:

    ```sass

    @swatch-options__listing__min-height: @swatch__listing__size;
    ```

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Fixed incorrect path to preload image when it contains `@` symbol.
 -  Fixed address data loss after first visit to the shopping cart page.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  New `require.async` function added for easier loading of dynamic dependencies.
    Usage example:

    ```js
    click: async function () {
        const [a, b] = await require.async(['a', 'b']);
        // or
        const a = await require.async('a');
    }
    ```

 -  Added ability to activate/deactivate focus trap using Cash widget:

    ```js
    $(el).focusTrap(true|false);
    ```

 -  Added ability to load [`tabbable` library](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable)
    without `focus-trap`:

    ```js
    const [tabbable] = await require.async(['tabbable']);
    ```

## September 18, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.18.0

 -  Fixed disabled "Submit Review" button when recaptcha is active.

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  Fixed ability to pass function as a second argument in `$.get|$.post` functions.
 -  Added `$.mixinSuper` utility. It works in the same way as [`$.mixin`](/docs/mixins)
    except parent method is not passed as a first argument, but available via
    `this._super()` call.
 -  Added `mage/utils/wrapper` utilities:

    ```js
    define(['mage/utils/wrapper'], (wrapper) => {
        console.log(wrapper);
    });
    ```

## September 4, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.16

 -  Fixed PHP error when Magento_CSP module exists but disabled.
 -  Improved error reporting when unable to load js component.

## September 3, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.14

 -  Fixed broken styles at checkout page when `use_css_critical_path` is enabled
    and Magento_CSP module is used.
 -  Fixed possibly broken HTML code after DOMDocument parser.

## August 13, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.17.12

 -  Allow method chaining when using $.Deferred object:

    ```js
    $.Deferred().then(fn1).fail(fn2);
    ```

 -  Fixed not working combined [onInteraction](/docs/components#oninteraction)
    and [onReveal](/docs/components#onreveal) load rules:

    ```xml
    <item name="load" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="onInteraction" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
        <item name="onReveal" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="0" xsi:type="string">.selector</item>
        </item>
    </item>
    ```

 -  Allow resolving js dependencies from nested properties:

    ```xml
    <item name="braintree" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="path" xsi:type="string">https://js.braintreegateway.com/web/3.97.2/js/client.min.js</item>
        <item name="global" xsi:type="string">braintree.client</item>
    </item>
    ```

    Now, the following code will work as expected:

    ```js
    define(['braintree'], (client) => {
        // Breeze will load remote js and properly resolve
        // exposed window.braintree.client property
        console.log(client);
    });
    ```

 -  Gallery dots styles moved to separate `.bz-gallery-nav-dots()` mixin for easier
    reuse per media query:

    ```scss
    & when (@critical) {
        @media @media-md-down {
            .breeze-gallery:not(.opened) .thumbnails {
                .bz-gallery-nav-dots();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

> swissup/breeze:2.17.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.8.1

 -  Performance improvements for slow internet connections.
 -  Improve product page performance when it has a lot of reviews.
 -  New rule for dynamic component initialization: [onDom](/docs/components#ondom).
 -  Fixed possible flash of scroll reveal elements on initial page load.
 -  Fixed redirect loop at "Login as Customer" page.
 -  Fixed image jumping when jarallax video is used on cms row element.
 -  Fixed missing styles for "Login as Customer" panel.
 -  Stability improvements in js code.

**🚨 Backward Incompatible Changes**

 -  All scripts except `core` and `knockout` bundles are now asynchronously loaded.
    This means that you have to define dependencies of your scripts using `import`
    section:

    ```diff
     <item name="Vendor_Module/js/catalog-add-to-cart" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="path" xsi:type="string">Vendor_Module/path/to/file</item>
    +    <item name="import" xsi:type="array">
    +       <item name="priceUtils" xsi:type="string">Magento_Catalog/js/price-utils</item>
    +    </item>
     </item>
    ```

 -  In case if your js creates mixin for built-in component, you need to add
    `mixins` property to your js declaration:

    ```diff
     <item name="Vendor_Module/js/catalog-add-to-cart" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="path" xsi:type="string">Vendor_Module/path/to/file</item>
    +    <item name="mixins" xsi:type="array">
    +       <item name="catalogAddToCart" xsi:type="string">catalogAddToCart</item>
    +    </item>
     </item>
    ```

 -  Scripts are no longer automatically loaded unless used in `require()`, or `data-mage-init`.
    If you have the scripts that are not used in `data-mage-init` and `require()` calls,
    and you want to load it every time when bundle is loaded, you need to add
    `autoload` property to your js declaration:

    ```diff
     <item name="items" xsi:type="array">
         <item name="custom-js" xsi:type="array">
             <item name="path" xsi:type="string">js/path/to/file</item>
    +        <item name="autoload" xsi:type="boolean">true</item>
         </item>
     </item>
    ```

**🚨 Backward Incompatible Changes**

 -  $.post and $.get functions no longer accept second argument as ajax request options.
    Now, it's always parsed as ajax request data to send. This change aligns the functions
    with jQuery Ajax API.

    Old, incorrect way:

    ```js
    $.post(url, {
        data: {},
        success: () => {}
    });
    ```

    New, correct way:

    ```js

        url: url,
        data: {},
        success: () => {}
    });
    ```

> swissup/breeze-blank:2.7.1

**👔 Added compatiblity with AdobeCommerce.**

## Feb 2, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.13.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.6.3

**🚀 Performance improvements**

 -  **[Dynamic JS](/docs/components#dynamic-component) feature added.**

    This feature allows to dynamically inject js components after specified event,
    or when some element is revealed in the viewport, or after first user interaction.

    Super useful for complex themes packed with tens of modules. Take a look at
    javascript size reduction on initial page load in our themes:

    Theme           | v2.12     | v2.13 | Improvement
    ----------------|-----------|-------|------------
    BreezeEvolution | 129kB     | 108kB | 16%
    ArgentoChic     | 225kB     | 111kB | 51%
    ArgentoForce    | 168kB     | 111kB | 34%
    ArgentoStripes  | 167kB     | 111kB | 34%

 -  **Added lazyload backgrounds for pagebuilder elements.**

    Pagebuilder slider, banner, and other components use background image
    property to create image. This makes impossible to use loading=lazy attribute
    and browser download all images on intial page load. We postpone loading of
    these background images until visitor scrolls to them.

    Theme           | v2.12     | v2.13 | Improvement
    ----------------|-----------|-------|------------
    BreezeEvolution | 276kB     | 169kB | 39%
    ArgentoChic     | 477kB     | 380kB | 21%
    ArgentoForce    | 691kB     | 432kB | 38%
    ArgentoStripes  | 712kB     | 410kB | 42%

**🏗️ Improved developer experience**

 -  **Allow extending custom uiComponents using `.extend()` function.**

    The code below is now fully compatible with Breeze:

    ```js
    define([
        'customComponent'
    ], function (customComponent) {
        'use strict';

        return customComponent.extend({...})
    })
    ```

    See real usage in [our repo](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze/blob/master/view/frontend/web/js/components/cart/totals.js).

 -  **Allow registering anonymous uiComponent using `Component.register` function.**

    This tricky mechanism allows to reuse Luma-based files. Take look on how we
    reuse files in our integrations with [AmastyXsearch](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-amasty-xsearch/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js),
    [MagefanBlog](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-magefan-blog/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js),
    [SmileElasticSuite](https://github.com/breezefront/module-breeze-smile-elasticsuite/tree/master/view/frontend/web/js).

 -  `uiRegistry` component added.
 -  Added/improved jQuery polyfills: `$.each, $.now, $.isObjectEmpty, $.get, $.post`
 -  `$.fn.onReveal` function added with an ability to pass IntersectionObserver options.

**🐛 Fixes**

 -  Fixed possible missing items in the header Account dropdown.
 -  Fixed possible infinite spinner on initial page load.
 -  Fixed possible horizontal scroll on customer registration page when DOB field is shown.
 -  Fixed js errors after multiple fast clicks on the same link.

## Jan 17, 2024

> swissup/breeze:2.12.0

 -  Allow using `@` in html attribute names.
 -  Improved `$(document).on('breeze:load')` event listener. It will now trigger callback even if "load"
    was triggered before event was attached. Similar to `$(document).ready()` from jQuery.
 -  Allow using body CSS class in `$.async('classname')` calls.
 -  Allow storing functions using `$.fn.data` method.
 -  Register all components constructors in $.breezemap.
 -  Improved `$.loadScript` function to prevent duplicate requests and preserve script execution order.
 -  Added [debug mode](/docs/settings) support for ajax requests.
 -  Small fixes to improve integration with Luma-based modules.

## Nov 28, 2023

> swissup/breeze:2.11.0<br>
> swissup/breeze-blank:2.6.0,swissup/breeze-evolution:2.1.6

**Breaking Changes**

 -  We've changed the code that will show login popup:

    ```js
    // old code
    $('.block-authentication').modal('openModal');

    // new code
    $('#authenticationPopup').authPopup('showModal')
    ```

    The old code will not work anymore because of performance optimizations -
    `.block-authentication` is no longer exists in DOM structure until popup is shown.

    So, if you've used `$('.block-authentication').modal('openModal');` to show
    login popup, you need to replace it with new call.

**New Features and Improvements**

 -  The message about proper performance setup added to the backend panel.

 -  Ability to run some logic in the widget when element [appears in viewport](/docs/widgets#onreveal).

 -  Added ability to hide currency title using `currency-separator` and `currency-title` classes.
 -  Added ability to use `absolute` position for [actions block](/docs/listing#actions-primary-and-secondary) when using grid listing.

**Fixes**
